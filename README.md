# Pomodoro Timer ðŸ•™

## About the Project

The Pomodoro Timer is a tool to track your work and rest times. You can use it to focus on your tasks, and then take breaks at set intervals. The application also stores your previous tasks in the 'History' page, so you can review your work over time.
**This is a portfolio project in which I've learned and applied various technologies.**
